Image datasets are useful for training a wide range of computer vision applications, such as
medical imaging technology, autonomous vehicles, and face recognition.

Labeled Faces in the Wild is a database of face photographs designed forstudying the problem of unconstrained face recognition. 
The data set containsmore than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name 
of the person pictured. 1680 of thepeople pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set.
