Machine learning is proving to be a golden opportunity for the financial sector. Financial quantitative records are kept for decades, 
so the industry is perfectly suited for machine learning. In fact, machine learning is already transforming finance and investment banking 
for algorithmic trading, stock market predictions, and fraud detection. In economics, machine learning can be used to test economic models 
and predict citizen behavior.
