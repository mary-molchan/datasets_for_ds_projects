A key part of completing a project is having data. Without training datasets, machine-learning algorithms would have no way of learning how to do text mining, text classification or categorize products.

A FEW TIPS FOR YOUR PROJECT:
- Look for datasets that require you to do some data understanding and data cleaning.
- Look for robust datasets with as many rows and columns as possible. That way you can practice working with large datasets and feature selection.
- You should come up with an interesting question that can be answered with the dataset.
- Follow a solid process and show that you aren't a scatter-trained novice who is doing things just because they can.
